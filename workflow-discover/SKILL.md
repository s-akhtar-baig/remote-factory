# Discover Workflow

The user wants: **$ARGUMENTS**

## Step: Discover

Auto-discover eval dimensions and generate the eval harness (eval_profile.json + eval/score.py).

```bash
factory discover $PROJECT_PATH
```

### CEO Review — Discover

Apply the CEO Review Gate protocol:
1. Read the agent output for the preceding step
2. Read artifacts: `.factory/eval_profile.json`, `eval/score.py`
3. Assess: Verify the discovered eval profile makes sense. Read .factory/eval_profile.json and eval/score.py. Check: Are the dimensions relevant to this project? Does score.py look correct? Any missing dimensions?
4. Write verdict to `.factory/reviews/ceo-verdict-discover.md`
5. **PROCEED** → continue to next step
6. **REDIRECT** → re-invoke the preceding agent with corrections (max 2)
7. **ABORT** → log failure and skip to archival

*On RELOOP: return to `discover` (max 3 iterations)*

## Step: Redetect

Re-detect project state after discovery to transition out of no_factory state.

```bash
factory detect $PROJECT_PATH
```
